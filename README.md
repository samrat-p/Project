# Non Adaptive Partial Image Encryption

Implementation of non adaptive image encryption method by `BRSNC` department of computer science undergraduates under `Dr. Sukalyan Som`'s mentorship on his novel reserch on `adaptive partial image encryption of grayscale image based on chaos`.

**Currently this project is under development.**
